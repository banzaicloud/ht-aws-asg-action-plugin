_Hollowtrees is a wave for the highest level, the pin-up centrefold for the Mentawai islands bringing a new machine-like level to the word perfection. Watch out for the vigilant guardian aptly named The Surgeons Table, whose sole purpose is to take parts of you as a trophy._

_Hollowtrees, a ruleset based watchguard is keeping spot instance based clusters safe and allows to use them in production.
It handles spot price surges within one region or availability zone gracefully and reschedules applications before instances are taking down. Hollowtrees follows the "batteries included but removable" principle and has plugins for different runtimes and frameworks. At the lowest level it manages spot based clusters of virtual machines, however it contains plugins for Kubernetes, Prometheus and the Pipeline API as well._
